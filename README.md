### Project: Develop a Shiny Application and it´s associated documentation

Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application. the steps you must follow are:

* Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
* Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
* Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

The application must include the following:

* Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
* Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
* Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
* You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
* The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
